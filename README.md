# Domain
The Domain layer is responsible for defining the core business logic of the application. It contains entities, use cases, and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to ensure a clear separation of concerns.

## ðŸ“Œ User_Entity

This file defines the User entity within the application's domain. It uses the Freezed package to simplify the creation of immutable classes and json_serializable to enable conversion between Dart objects and JSON.
The User entity is a sealed class that represents different user states within the system. It can take three forms:

- **User:** Represents a regular user with an ID, name, and email.

- **User.notLogged():** Represents a user who has not yet authenticated.

- **User.logged(...):** Represents an authenticated user, incluing authentication tokens.
